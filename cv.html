      <p><em>Canonical</em> is best known as the company that delivers Ubuntu,
      an open source software platform that runs everywhere from the smartphone
      to the cloud.</p>

      <p>I'm currently working with Canonical to support their web
      offering in the front end space across their multiple product streams.</p>

      <p>Canonical's core mission to make open source software available to people
      everywhere and one of the many perks of working with them is the ability to
      contribute back to the open source community. One highlight I'm currently
      working on is Vanilla Framework, a SASS based framework of patterns to support
      all of Canonical's upcoming web releases.</p>

      <p><em>Made by Many</em> is an award winning innovation accelerator based in Angel.
      I'm worked with them over 5 two week sprints to develop a complex Ruby on Rails product with an
      accompanying Pattern Library for a leading scientic laboratory.</p>

      <p>The lab was a large corporate with multiple competing sub-brands so the challenge
      was to develop an over-arching set of patterns &amp; living components that
      could be thread through multiple products to build a cohesive overall brand.</p>

      <p>Within the first 3 months, the user base quickly grew to over 250,000
      registered users. In Oct 2014, after just one year live, FutureLearn is
      fast approaching 1.5 million enrolments.</p>

      <p>The product is built in Ruby on Rails, using HAML and SASS on the front
      end. The team worked using Agile to gain real-time feedback from beta users
      to shape the product. I was one of two contracting Front Enders who helped
      build a scalable, modular, front end architecture which the maturing team
      can now inherit and build upon further.</p>
